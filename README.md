# Javascript 1 | Course Assignment
In the final assignment for this javascript topic, I've tried to shape the different parts of this assignment as I understood it was meant to be solved and based on what we've learned so far, and the lessons I have learned and as I understood them so far. I haven't shaped the javascript data and layout exactly the way as I wanted, but I'll still deliver it for consideration. 
Inside this folder, outside this readME file, we can find:

**Files that belong to this html-file:**
```

JS > script.js and JS > components > errorMessage.js
```
## details.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
```
